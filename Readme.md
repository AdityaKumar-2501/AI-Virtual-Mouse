<h1 align="center" id="title">AI Virtual Mouse</h1>

<p id="description">In this repository I am developing an AI virtual mouse that uses the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries to detect the fingertips of the hand and record the hand movements in real time. You can use your fingers and a laptop camera to accomplish mouse functions without actually using a physical mouse.</p>
